MS in Data Science from University at Buffalo

My Projects done in Python, R and Spark (PySpark)

1. Multi-Class Text Classification with PySpark - Collected news articles from Politics, Business, Sports and Movies category of New York Times to train classifiers from Spark MLLib. And test those classifiers with unknown set of articles to see how accurately do they classify them.

2. Wine Quality Analysis - Performed both regression and classification analyses on the given datasets and developed significant predictive models in R that predicted which properties contributed more towards quality of white wine, checked the performances of the methods on the datasets and, in the process, implemented best subset selection method, multiple regression analysis, boosting and support vector machines.

3. Twitter Application Development - Using twitteR package in R integrated into Jupyter Notebook, with the SearchAPI collected tweets associated with flu using keywords. Filtered out tweets with geo-locations, followed by filtering them by USA locations as in Google Maps API. Plotted on the map of the USA with colors according to the number of tweets using Plotly and RColorBrewer library for a general analysis of which states are more affected by Influenza.

4. Reproducible Work in R Environment - Using R integrated into Jupyter Notebook, produced almost same graphs as presented by Influenza Division of CDC, USA
