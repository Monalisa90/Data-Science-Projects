MS in Data Science from University at Buffalo

My Projects done in Python, R and Spark (PySpark)

1. Multi-Class Text Classification with PySpark - Collected news articles from Politics, Business, Sports and Movies category of New York Times to train classifiers from Spark MLLib. And test those classifiers with unknown set of articles to see how accurately do they classify them.

2. Wine Quality Analysis - Performed both regression and classification analyses on the given datasets and developed significant predictive models in R that predicted which properties contributed more towards quality of white wine, checked the performances of the methods on the datasets and, in the process, implemented best subset selection method, multiple regression analysis, boosting and support vector machines.

3. Twitter Application Development - Using twitteR package in R integrated into Jupyter Notebook, with the SearchAPI collected tweets associated with flu using keywords. Filtered out tweets with geo-locations, followed by filtering them by USA locations as in Google Maps API. Plotted on the map of the USA with colors according to the number of tweets using Plotly and RColorBrewer library for a general analysis of which states are more affected by Influenza.

4. Reproducible Work in R Environment - Using R integrated into Jupyter Notebook, produced almost same graphs as presented by Influenza Division of CDC, USA

2017-2018 Influenza Season Week 4 ending January 27, 2018
A Reproducible Work in R

Synopsis: During week 4 (January 21-27, 2018), influenza activity increased in the United States.

Viral Surveillance: The most frequently identified influenza virus subtype reported by public health laboratories during week 4 was influenza A(H3). The percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical laboratories remained elevated

Pneumonia and Influenza Mortality: The proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza (P&I) was above the system-specific epidemic threshold in the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Mortality Surveillance System

Influenza-associated Pediatric Deaths: A total of 53 influenza-associated pediatric deaths have been reported for the 2017-2018 season

Influenza-associated Hospitalizations: A cumulative rate of 51.4 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations per 100,000 population was reported

Outpatient Illness Surveillance: The proportion of outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) was 7.1%, which is above the national baseline of 2.2%. All 10 regions reported ILI at or above region-specific baseline levels.

ILINet State Activity Indicator Map: New York City, the District of Columbia, and 42 states experienced high ILI activity; Puerto Rico and two states experienced moderate ILI activity; three states experienced low ILI activity; and three states experienced minimal ILI activity
