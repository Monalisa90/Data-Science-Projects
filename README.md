Here, I have my works done as part of acadamic projects.

1. Multi-Class Text Classification with PySpark - Collected news articles from Politics, Business, Sports and Movies category of New York Times to train classifiers from Spark MLLib. And test those classifiers with unknown set of articles to see how accurately do they classify them.

2. Wine Quality Analysis - Performed both regression and classification analyses on the given datasets and developed significant predictive models in R that predicted which properties contributed more towards quality of white wine, checked the performances of the methods on the datasets and, in the process, implemented best subset selection method, multiple regression analysis, boosting and support vector machines.

3. Food Inspection Chicago - Analyzed food inspection data of Chicago using Pythonâ€™s Pandas and Matplotlib library and normalized the data in Jupyter Notebook, loaded cleaned data into MySQL, fetched relevant information through Jupyter Notebook by establishing a database connection and predicted which establishment types are most likely to get caught in most of the inspections, visualized the potential areas using BaseMap, and computed posterior probabilities of establishment types in inspection based on prior information and hypothesis by using Bayesian Statistical Analysis.

4. Reproducible Work in R Environment - Using R integrated into Jupyter Notebook, produced almost same graphs as presented by Influenza Division of CDC, USA
